# PROJECT 2: DATA MODELLING WITH CASSANDRA

## 1. Introduction
### a. Brief info:
Sparkify - a music streaming app startup wants to analyse on the data they have been collecting on songs and users. Currently, it is not easy to query the data to generate the result since all data was in CSV files on user activities

### b. Objectives:
We basically create a Cassandra database creating queries on song play to answer question and initiately bring to the project. In this project, we create a database to analysis. Furthermore, we have ability to test our DB by running queries given by the analytic team and create the result.

### c. Overview:
In this project: we apply what I've learnt on data modelling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using python. To complete, is is needed to create tables, provide part of pipeline to transfer data from CSV file within a directory(here is event_data folder) to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables

## 2. Dataset
For this project, we worked with one dataset `event_data`. This directory of CSV files partitioned by date.

Ex:
`event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv

event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv`
